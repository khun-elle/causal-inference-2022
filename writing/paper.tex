\section{Introduction}

This paper analyzes incarceration data in 2002. The variable \texttt{incarcerated} is assigned to 1 if the person was incarcerated and 0 otherwise. Then, I calculate total incarcerations by race and gender. Section 2 presents a bar graph of total number of incarcerations in 2002 by race and gender, a table of total number of incarcerations, and a regression table.

\section{Data}

Figure ~\ref{fig:graph} presents the total number of incarceration in 2002 categorized by race and gender. From the graph, we see that male were incarcerated a lot more than female for all race. Black male were incarcerated the most followed by Non-Black/Non-Hispanic and Hispanic respectively.

The table below shows total number of incarcerations by race and gender.

Table 2 presents the regression output regressing \texttt{incarcerations in 2002} on race and gender. The constant term reflects the probability of being incarcerated in 2002 for black female (base group). The coefficient -0.014 on Hispanic means that for female hispanic, the probability of being incarcerated is 1.4 percentage points lower than that of black female
